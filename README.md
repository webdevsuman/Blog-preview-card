## My process

I first set the HTML codes and then style it. I kept in mind using the semantic tags as much as possible. After desktop design is completed, I try to make it responsive for smaller screens.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Giving each component the right gap and alignment, that is what I have mostly learnt through this project. Changing mouse pointer on hover is another to my list.

### Continued development

I am still chasing after the secret codes to make a site responsive by default without needing to use media queries.
